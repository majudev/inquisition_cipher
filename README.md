# inquisition_cipher
I'm sure you didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.  
## WTF is that?
This is simple cipher based on Playfair (check out on Wikipedia).
It allows you to encrypt data via C++.
## Why to use it?
Idk. Just for fun. It's not really useful yet. I'm also developing network library
using Merkle's Puzzles to communicate, maybe when it's done it will be any kind useful.
Anyway. Just try it yourself.
